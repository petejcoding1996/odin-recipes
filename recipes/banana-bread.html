    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A banana bread and drizzle cake hybrid, this is a quick, easy and tasty loaf, which will leave family wanting more.</p>
    <p>This quick recipe can be frozen. It's great if you need to use your overripe bananas, too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>140g soft butter</li>
       <li>140g caster sugar</li> 
       <li>2 large eggs (beaten)</li> 
       <li>140g self-raising flour</li> 
       <li>1 tsp baking powder</li> 
       <li>2 very ripe bananas (mashed)</li> 
       <li>50g icing sugar</li> 
       <li>handful dried banana chips</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
        <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
        <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.</li>
    </ol>
